# meta-atom-method-for-alloy
This is the basic function for the meta atom method, which is designed for complex alloys.

This method is developed by Peng Wang at Shanghai University.

A series of potentials for alloy has been developed in the framework of meta-atom method.

The proposed meta-atom method is based on the following conjecture: the mechanical properties of an alloy system are primarily governed by a finite set of material constants, such as the lattice constants, the surface energy, the stable and unstable stacking fault energies (SFE), the elastic moduli, the sublimation energy and the vacancy formation energy. Once the completeness of this set of material constants is established, two systems with the same material constants should exhibit identical mechanical behaviors in experimental observations. In this way, a detailed distinction among various atomic species is discarded and an alloy system is represented by a set of meta-atoms with a single interatomic potential to fit all related material constants.

The potentials we have developed include:

Twin induced plasticity (TWIP) steels-----FeMn alloy

TaHfZrTi high-entropy alloy-----TaHfZrTi alloy

Aluminum bronzes-----CuAl alloy

FeCoNiCrMn high-entropy alloy-----FeCoNiCrMn alloy
